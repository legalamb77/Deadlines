I want to write a python script that does basic tracking of deadlines.

Each deadline is an id which is stored in a dictionary, with data corresponding to a tuple: (Date it's due on,Priority)

A dictionary of these deadlines is stored in the usr profile? I'll have to see where the best place to do this is.

This file is constant.

The script can also be queried by typing Deadlines.py add (deadline,Date,Priority), or Deadlines.py delete (deadline)

At startup of a terminal, a function in the script is called in the .bashrc, which lists the deadlines in a sorted order, with a balance between the Date and the Priority. (Lower priority that's soon may outweigh a high priority a year from now.)

##Just realized that I'll need to implement a function to actually decrease the days each day... Hm...

I could do this by checking the date when the script is being run, and also storing the date when a deadline was added.
