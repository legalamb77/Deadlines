This is a simple script that I wrote to provide some functionality to my terminal.

It is unfinished at the moment.

In its final state, the plan is to have it track a list of open deadlines.

Functionality includes addition and deletion of deadlines, and displaying a sorted list of open deadlines.

Sorting is planned to be a balance between the deadlines due date and its priority.
