This is a simple script that I wrote to provide some functionality to my terminal.

Functionality includes addition and deletion of deadlines, and displaying a sorted list of open deadlines.

The sorting algorithm, used when calling 'default' as the argument to the --s command, balances priority with the remaining days until the deadline passes.

1 is the highest priority, and 10 is the lowest, in this application.
